# -K-means-Clustering-and-Image-Compression
This repository contains Python code to implement the K-means algorithm and use it for image compression. The code is divided into several parts:
Implementing K-means: This section covers the implementation of the K-means algorithm, including finding the closest centroids and computing centroid means.

K-means on a Sample Dataset: Demonstrates how the K-means algorithm works on a toy 2D dataset. Visualizations are provided to illustrate the progress of the algorithm.

Random Initialization: Discusses the random initialization of centroids and its importance in the K-means algorithm.

Image Compression with K-means: Applies K-means to compress an image by reducing the number of colors used. The process involves selecting 16 representative colors from the image and replacing each pixel with the closest representative color.
